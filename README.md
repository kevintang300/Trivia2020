# Trivia2020


## Description
This project is based around ATMega32 Controller. There are only 2 categories (Pop culture and Sports)  that are implemented due to the lack of storage the microcontroller can hold. Each category holds a series ofrandomized questions. A score out of 10 will be displayed on the LED once 10 randomized questions have been asked. A 70% or higher will produce a pleasing low to high tune, otherwise it will produce a gloomy high to low tune. 


- **Category:** Games
